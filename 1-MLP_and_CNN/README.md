## Description
We studied and implemented three of the most famous and powerful generative models, namely __Variational Auto Encoders__ (VAEs), __Generative Adversarial Networks__ (GANs) and __Generative Normalizing Flows__ (NFs). We analyzed both from theoretical and practical spectrum, we presented their mathematical framework and results for practical implementations.
